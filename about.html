        <h2>Credit cards meaning</h2>
        <p>A credit card is a financial offering that offers a credit limit for shopping and other transactions. The
            card also lets you convert your purchases into easy EMIs. You must repay the used credit limit on or
            before the due date to avoid interest.</p>
        <p>The credit card information includes credit card number, cardholderâ€™s name, expiration date, signature,
            CVC code, etc. The best part about a credit card is that it is not linked to a bank account. So,
            whenever you swipe your credit card, the amount is deducted from your credit card limit, not your bank
            account. You can use it to pay for food, clothes, take care of medical expenses, travel expenses, and
            other lifestyle products and emergency services. </p>
