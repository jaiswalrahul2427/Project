            <h2>Credit cards meaning</h2>
            <p>A credit card is a financial offering that offers a credit limit for shopping and other transactions. The
                card also lets you convert your purchases into easy EMIs. You must repay the used credit limit on or
                before the due date to avoid interest.</p>
            <p>The credit card information includes credit card number, cardholder’s name, expiration date, signature,
                CVC code, etc. The best part about a credit card is that it is not linked to a bank account. So,
                whenever you swipe your credit card, the amount is deducted from your credit card limit, not your bank
                account. You can use it to pay for food, clothes, take care of medical expenses, travel expenses, and
                other lifestyle products and emergency services. </p>
            <h3>Advantages of Best Credit Card</h3>
            <p>After knowing what a credit card is, let us find out the benefits that come with it. Depending on your
                needs, a credit card comes with a host of features and benefits to save money while making transactions.
                Here are the top benefits to help you to know more about credit cards: </p>
            <div class="cards2">
                <div class="card2">
                    <h4>Hassle-free shopping experience</h4>
                    <p>The benefit of having the best credit card is that it has made shopping easier and convenient.
                        You no longer need to visit malls or stores to make purchases. With your credit card, you can
                        make big purchases from the comfort of your home. It can help you avoid putting any burden on
                        your monthly budget with a credit card. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="card2">
                    <h4>No need to carry cash</h4>
                    <p>Credit cards are the best alternative to cash, as it eliminates the need for carrying cash.
                        Credit cards are accepted almost anywhere you go. If you do not have cash, you can simply use
                        your Kotak Mahindra credit card to cover your expenses and repay the outstanding amount at the
                        end of the month.  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="card2">
                    <h4>Rewards, cashback, and offers</h4>
                    <p>The best credit card comes with rewards and cashback that fits your needs and requirements.
                        Depending on your credit card issuer, your credit card comes with a host of special discounts,
                        cashback, or rewards points for purchases made through it. Before getting a credit card, it is
                        imperative to assess your needs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card2">
                    <h4>Easy cash withdrawal </h4>
                    <P>Another benefit of having the best credit card is that it allows you to withdraw cash whenever
                        the need arises. However, it is worth noting that using your credit card to withdraw cash
                        follows a small fee that you will have to bear while repaying your outstanding amount.</P>
                </div>
                <div class="card2">
                    <h4>Widely accepted</h4>
                    <P>The best thing about a credit card is that it is accepted worldwide, as it is the most common
                        mode of payment across the world. You can use your Kotak Mahindra credit card to make
                        international bookings and payments at airlines, restaurants, hotels, stores, and petrol pumps
                        with ease. It makes your travels around the world convenient. </P>
                </div>
                <div class="card2">
                    <h4>Meet emergencies</h4>
                    <p>If you are wondering what is a credit card, it is a type of loan that offers to cover the cost of
                        emergencies for you and your family. For instance, you can use your credit card to pay your
                        medical bills. It eliminates the worrying of arranging funds for your medical bills. Keep in
                        mind that you will have to make on-time payments to avoid hefty interest charges and higher
                        APR%.</p>
