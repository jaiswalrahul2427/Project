        <h1>RBI Guidelines for Credit Cards</h1>
        <h2>Who can issue cards</h2>
        <p>As per RBI, most Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) with a net worth of Rs. 100 crores can issue credit cards.
            However, the exception is Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) as it needs to collaborate with other banks to do so.
            Moreover, Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) with a net worth of more than Rs. 100 crores can issue cards
            subject to certain guidelines. NBFCs registered with the RBI with a minimum net owned fund of Rs. 100 crores
            can issue credit cards, but they should have a Certificate of Registration and permission to enter the
            business.</p>
        <h2>Issue of Co-branded cards</h2>
        <p>Banks do not require RBI’s approval to issue co-branded credit cards. UCBs cannot issue credit cards in
            tie-ups with other non-bank entities.</p>
        <h2>Explicit written consent for cards</h2>
        <p>RBI rules state that explicit written consent will be required for all cards issued by a card issuer.
            Moreover, alternative digital modes with multifactor authentication are also eligible to be used in place of
            writing. However, that needs to be communicated to the RBI’s Department of Regulations.</p>
        <h2>Issue of unsolicited facilities</h2>
        <p>Credit card issuers cannot unilaterally upgrade credit cards and increase credit limits. They will require
            explicit consent from the customer for all changes in terms and conditions.</p>
        <h2>Reporting to credit information companies</h2>
        <p>In this guideline, card issuers cannot report any credit information about a new credit card account to
            Credit Information Companies (CICs) before the card is activated. In case any such information is provided
            to CIC, the card issuer will be required to inform the customer.</p>
